The Task: Predict the review score (1-5 stars) from the review text.

The dataset consists of Amazon reviews and we are looking at a particular category: "Fashion". The data can be downloaded here: http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/categoryFilesSmall/AMAZON_FASHION_5.json.gz and more information is available here: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html

There is no "right" solution to this. Just predict as well as you can and during the interview we will review your approach together.

Generally we would advise to not spend more than 3 hours on this.
